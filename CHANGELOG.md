# 2.0.0+1.20 - 16/06/2023
- Added ability to trim elytra. This is compatible both with banner patterns and dyeing your elytra.
- Rewrote core mod logic, this release is **not compatible** with previous versions!
  - The mod should now be more compatible with other mods that interact with the vanilla elytra!
